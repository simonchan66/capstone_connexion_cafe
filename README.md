### introduction

The [Connexion Café](https://connexion.wccac.net/), located at [Westside Calgary Chinese Alliance Church](https://www.wccac.net/), is a non-profit ministry that aims to provide a space for inter-generational and inter-congregational conversations as well as relationship building. The café operates on a simple and traditional business model, where customers choose from a menu of drinks and snacks, and the sales are recorded manually by the staff using pen and paper. This method reflects the café's dedication to a personal approach in serving its community. However, the café recognizes the potential benefits of upgrading its system to enhance efficiency and improve customer service.
